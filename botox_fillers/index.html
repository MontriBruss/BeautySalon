          <div class="medium-3 columns gray center">
            <p><STRONG>WHAT IS BOTOX INJECTION</p>
            <BR>
              <P >Botulinum toxin Type A is a prescription only drug that can only be prescribed by a Doctor, an Independent Nurse Prescriber or a Dentist. There are a number of different brands of Botulinum toxin, but most people are familiar with one: Botox. Some practitioners will call all Botulinum toxin botox, so to make reading easier, we’ll do the same.</P>
            
          </div>
          <div class="medium-3 columns gray center">
             <p><STRONG>HOW DOES IT WORK?</p>
             <p>Nerves release a chemical signal called acetylcholine to muscles causing them to contract. Continued expressions can produce a line or wrinkle in the overlying skin. These are called dynamic lines – they appear as a result of expression. Botulinum toxin is injected directly into the relevant muscles and works by blocking these chemical signals.</p><br/>
                <span id="link-id" style="display:inheret;"><a href="javascript:ShowContent('uniquename');">READ MORE</a>
                  </span> <div id="uniquename" style="display:none;">
                    <p> After several days (up to two weeks), the injected muscle can no longer contract, causing lines and wrinkles that usually result from certain facial expressions to relax and soften. Lines and wrinkles caused by sun damage, loss of skin elasticity as we age and gravity, or loss of volume, will not respond to botox. It will soften lines that are still visible when the face is at rest, but it won’t completely eliminate them. </p>

          <div class="medium-3 columns gray center">
            <p><STRONG>WHAT AREAS CAN BE INJECTED</p>
            <p>Botox is generally injected in the upper third of the face (from the eyes upwards).Treatment is divided into areas: One area is between the eyebrows (often called the number eleven lines that appear when we look cross). Another area is the horizontal lines across the forehead that appear when we look surprised. Another area is the crow’s feet to both eyes when we smile.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="medium-3 columns gray center">
            <p><STRONG>HOW IS THE BOTOX PROCEDURE PERFORMED</p>
            <p>A consultation is booked for first time clients to go through your medical history and discuss your treatment. Once this is undertaken, an appointment is booked for the treatment. Botuilinum toxin takes up to 72 hours to take effect and make a noticeable difference. Botulinum toxin is administered by diluting the powder in saline and injecting it directly into the muscle.</p>
                 <span id="link-id1" style="display:inheret;"><a href="javascript:ShowContent('uniquename1');">READ MORE</a>
                  </span> <div id="uniquename1" style="display:none;">
                    <p>  It takes up to two weeks for botulinum toxin to start to take effect, although most clients report that it can work within days. A free review at 2 weeks is offered. The actual treatment only takes only a few minutes. The client is asked to work the muscle (for example, by frowning) just prior to the injection and a fine needle is used, with only minor discomfort. <br>How long does it last? <br>Clinical studies advise 3 months, although this can vary from person to person. As the muscles action gradually returns, the lines and wrinkles begin to re-appear and wrinkles. I often advise clients to have every 3 months for the first year to break their own frowning reflex. The lines and wrinkles often appear less severe with time because the muscles are being trained to relax.</p> </p>

            <p><STRONG>WHAT IS AZZALURE</p>
            <BR>
              <P >There are different types of botulinum toxin on the market. Most people are familiar with the name Botox, but this is the brand name of one toxin (the original) produced by Allergan. I use two different types, both of which I consider to be effective, to offer people a choice as individuals may prefer one brand over another. This will all be discussed in the consultation.</P>
            
          </div>
          <div class="medium-4 columns gray center">
             <p><STRONG>WHAT ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS?</p><BR>
             <p>Bruising is reported as a common side effect, although I don’t find it that common, clients should be aware that any injection can result in a bruise no matter how long you’ve been having it bruise free. Although botox has been used to treat migraines, one of the less common side effects may be headaches.</p><br/>

                    <p>  A small percentage of patients may develop eyelid droop which may last several weeks. Advice on avoiding this is given at the time of treatment, but typically if you avoid rubbing or massaging the injected area for 24 hours, avoid the gym or any activity that may involve excessive head movement.</p>

            <p>If you suffer from a neurological disease, such as Myasthenia Gravis, you should not receive botox. Certain types of antibiotics (usually the types you would have injected at a dentists or fed through a drip in hospital) may cause a reaction with the Botox, so would disqualify you from treatment. If you are trying for a baby, pregnant or breastfeeding I won’t administer treatment. </p>

          <div class="medium-4 columns gray center">
            <p><STRONG>WHAT ARE DERMAL FILLERS</p>
            <BR>
              <P >While botox is injected to stop muscle movement causing dynamic lines, dermal fillers are used on static lines (lines that are there at rest). Dermal fillers plump out, smooth or fill specific lines or replace lost volume. Many clients will have both botox and fillers as they work in different ways on different parts of the face to produce an overall fresher, more youthful appearance.</P>
            
          </div>
          <div class="medium-4 columns gray center">
             <p><STRONG>SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL DERMAL FILLERS</p><BR>
             <p>There are two primary groups of dermal fillers: synthetic and natural (the most widely known is hyaluronic acid). Natural fillers carry a much smaller risk of causing an allergic reaction, although reactions can still occur. Hyaluronic acid fillers are widely used in the United Kingdom due to their high levels of safety and reliability. It is a natural substance which can be found in every living organism.</p>
                <span id="link-id4" style="display:inheret;"><a href="javascript:ShowContent('uniquename4');">READ MORE</a>
                  </span> <div id="uniquename4" style="display:none;">
                    <p>   As a result, it is biocompatible and side-effects are very rare. The injected hyaluronic acid is chemically and physically cross linked to avoid rapid degradation. By injecting hyaluronic acid, your skin can regain thickness and substance. Once injected, the hyaluronic acid absorbs water from its environment and add to the above effects.</p>

            <p><STRONG>WHAT AREAS CAN BE INJECTED</p><BR>
            <p>Generally, where botox is used for the upper third of the face, fillers are used in the lower face. Different types of filler are used to do a variety of treatments including: Lips – either plumping out lips to add volume, smoothing out fine lines or enhancing area around the lips. Cheeks – restoring lost volume to the mid face Nose to mouth lines - adding volume and smoothing out the deep creases that run from the nose to the mouth </p>

            <BR>
              <P >Hyaluronic acid fillers come in varying levels of thickness and so they are a flexible option to improve different sections of the face. Thinner fillers are more suitable for wrinkles and fine lines, or enrichment of the lips (such as Juvederm Smile or Juvederm 3), </P><BR>

                    <p>  while thicker fillers are able to address very deep wrinkles (Juvederm 4 or Volbella) and volume loss (Voluma). During the consultation what you are hoping to achieve and how long you hope results will last will be discussed and advice given on which filler would be most suitable.</p>

             <p>Results are immediate, although there is a settling period of several days (in case of swelling or bruising). The longevity of the filler depends on the type used, but also on the amount of volume it needs to restore. Generally, fillers last about 6-9 months (usually closer to 6 months in the lip area), </p><br/>

                    <p>  Vycross fillers last longer – Volift lasts 12-15 months and Voluma around 18 months. Once the filler starts to dissipate you need to go back in and get more filler injected to maintain results</p>
